# Strap'd ToolKit

Strap'd ToolKit is a JavaScript framework for building sites with Bootstrap.  It handles construction and insertion of HTML as well as providing some easy methods of using Bootstrap's built-in element styling for typed elements (like buttons).  In the future, it will provide the means to attach data sources to objects that will affect the display of the object and will update with the data source.

## Using StrapTK
Strap was designed for use by JavaScript developers that are sick of writing HTML (like me).
